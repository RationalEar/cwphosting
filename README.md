#New Project!!! CWP Hosting Manager

CWP Hosting Manager is  going to be a platform that will allow anyone to provide hosting services using CWP Pro.
The software will provide billing and invoicing features with auto-configiration of user accounts in CWP.
This will be similar to Cpanel's WHM.

I'm currently right at the beginning of this software and have just done authentication and authorization using JWT and MongoDB.
With time will add support of database of your choice e.g relational databases.
